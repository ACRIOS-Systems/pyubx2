# How to contribute

Here are some guidelines on how to contribute to the pyubx2 project.

We appreciate any contribution, from fixing a grammar mistake in a comment to implementing new functionality. Please read this section if you are contributing your work.

Being one of our contributors, you agree and confirm that:

* The work is all your own.
* Your work will be distributed under a BSD 3-Clause License once your pull request is merged.
* You submitted work fulfils or mostly fulfils our styles and standards.

Please help us keep our issue list small by adding fixes: #{$ISSUE_NO} to the commit message of pull requests that resolve open issues. GitHub will use this tag to auto close the issue when the PR is merged.

## Coding conventions

  * This is open source software. We endeavour to make the code as transparent as possible.
  * We use [Eclipse PyDev](https://www.pydev.org/) for development and testing, but you are at liberty to use your preferred IDE.
  * We use [pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) (>=2.6.0) for code analysis.
  * We use [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) (>= 20.8) for code formatting and ask that you do the same.

## Testing

We use python's native unittest framework for local unit testing, complemented by the Travis CI automated build and testing workflow. We endeavour to have 100% code coverage.

Please write unittest examples for new code you create and add them to the /tests folder following the naming convention test_*.py.

We test on the following platforms using u-blox [NEO-6](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-6-series), [NEO-7](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-7-series) and [NEO-8](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-m8-series) devices:
* Windows 10
* MacOS (Big Sur)
* Linux (Ubuntu Bionic)
* Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to pyubx2](https://github.com/semuconsulting/pyubx2/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)). Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."



Thanks,
